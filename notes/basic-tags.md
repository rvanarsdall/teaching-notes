## Header Tags

They help with the structure of a webpage. Screen readers use these tags to help visually impaired users navigate the page. Headers can also help with SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These are the header tags. `<h1>` is the largest and `<h6>` is the smallest.
- They have opening and closing tags.
- Do not use headers for styling purposes. Use CSS for styling.

## Paragraph Tags

They are used to display text content on a webpage. They are block-level elements. The browser adds a line break before and after the paragraph and has some default styling.

- `<p>`: This is the paragraph tag.
- It has an opening and closing tag.

## Self-Closing Tags

Some tags do not have closing tags. They are called self-closing tags. They do not have any content inside them.

- `<img>`: This tag is used to display images.
- `<br>`: This tag is used to add a line break.
- `<hr>`: This tag is used to add a horizontal line.
