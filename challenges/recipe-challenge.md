Codeberry Muffins Recipe

Ingredients:
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 cup milk
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.

Gently fold in the blueberries.

Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.

Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

Remove the muffins from the oven and let them cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your delicious homemade blueberry muffins!

Note: Feel free to customize this recipe by adding lemon zest, cinnamon, or a streusel topping if desired.
